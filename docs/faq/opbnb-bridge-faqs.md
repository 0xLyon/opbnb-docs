### What is the status of the integration between opBNB and Optimism's Superchain?

opBNB is a project that aims to bring the benefits of L2 scaling and user-friendly UX to the BNB ecosystem. It will enable fast and cheap transactions on BNB L2, as well as smooth interoperability with Greenfield, a decentralized platform for building and running applications. 
Superchain is an innovative solution that leverages OP Stack to provide L2/L3 scaling and security for Ethereum. It allows users to access various L2 protocols with a single wallet and enjoy low fees and high throughput. opBNB is interested in collaborating with Superchain and integrating OP Stack into BNBChain.
