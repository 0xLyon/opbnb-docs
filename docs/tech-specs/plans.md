## Future Plans for opBNB(2023)

Developing opBNB on BNB Chain has been an exciting and rewarding journey for us. We have faced some challenges along the way, such as adapting to BNB Chain's unique features and specifications, testing our code on different environments and networks, and ensuring the compatibility and interoperability of opBNB with other BNB Chain projects and protocols.

However, we have also encountered many opportunities and benefits from building opBNB on BNB Chain. BNB Chain is a fast-growing and vibrant ecosystem that offers a rich variety of dApps, DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and gaming projects. BNB Chain also has a large and active community of users, developers, and validators that support its development and adoption. By deploying opBNB on BNB Chain, we can tap into this ecosystem and community and provide them with a scalable and secure layer 2 solution that enhances their experience and value.

We are currently working hard to launch the opBNB testnet, which will allow users and developers to try out opBNB and give us feedback on its functionality and performance. We are also working on integrating opBNB with other BNB Chain projects and protocols. We aim to create a seamless and interoperable layer 2 ecosystem on BNB Chain that offers users and developers more choices and possibilities.
