## Cross Chain Communication

### opBNB Protocol addresses

The opBNB protocol contracts are smart contracts that enable the execution of transactions on the opBNB network. The main contracts are:

- batchInbox: This contract receives batches of transactions from the Sequencer on L1. 
- batchSender: This contract is the authorized sender of batches to the batchInbox. It can be changed by the SystemConfig contract, which governs the parameters of the opBNB network.
- outputProposer: This contract proposes outputs for the opBNB nodes to execute. It receives inputs from the batchInbox and other sources, and generates outputs that are consistent with the opBNB protocol rules.
